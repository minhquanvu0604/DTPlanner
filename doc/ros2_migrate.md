# CMakeLists.txt
OpenCV: for offset_path_plot.cpp

Haven't ported these, there could be better way :

- set_target_properties(get_next_edges_test PROPERTIES
    RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}")

Check out 
- install(TARGETS...) 
- if(BUILD_TESTING)

# package.xml
- Format 3

- Erase <depend>nodelet</depend>

# d_triang_color_light_ros.hpp

- In ROS 2, all message types are scoped within their respective package namespaces and follow the msg namespace pattern, e.g., ackermann_msgs::AckermannDriveStamped -> ackermann_msgs::msg::AckermannDriveStamped

- Instead of using ros::NodeHandle, use rclcpp::Node::SharedPtr

- Subscription and publisher initialization

    - In ROS 2, Publisher is strongly-typed and make more use of smart pointers
    change ros::Publisher _pub_command_vel; to rclcpp::Publisher<ackermann_msgs::msg::AckermannDriveStamped>::SharedPtr _pub_command_vel;

    - publishers are more tightly integrated with the nodes' lifecycle.  This is part of ROS 2â€™s design to support more robust and complex distributed systems, including those that require lifecycle management for nodes (using Managed Nodes).

- rate management: ROS 2 uses rclcpp::Rate similar to ROS 1, need to ensure it's integrated correctly with the asynchronous spinning mechanism (rclcpp::spin or similar)

# d_triang_color_light_ros.cpp
Only change the constructor (pub, sub init)
